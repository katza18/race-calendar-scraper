# Racing Calendar

The purpose of this project is to develop a calendar that scrapes the web for data on popular racing series and posts them to a calendar. The user should be able to create a custom calendar based on their needs and save their preferences to their devices calendar with an ics file.

# Project Sample

Users initially have a blank calendar and are able to toggle different race series.

Puppeteer - I used puppeteer to scrape for the calendar info

# Future Plans

I would like to continue to add different race series to be toggled on the calendar as well as other sports.
