# Racing Calendar
The purpose of this project is to develop a calendar that scrapes the web for data on popular racing series and posts them to a calendar. The user should be able to create a custom calendar based on their needs and save their preferences to their devices calendar with an ics file.

# Technologies
Puppeteer - I used puppeteer to scrape for the calendar info

# Future Plans
